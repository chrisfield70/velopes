** log of stuff/activity


* Monday 22 June 2015 *

ok so 
took an existing heroku app - secure-tundra-6182, http://secure-tundra-6182.herokuapp.com/
setup a github repo
linked the repo to heroku
added CNAME (and setup within heroku), http://heroku.bluelatitude.net
then on my machine, setup python, http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/ (added homebrew, pip virtualenv)
grabed the sample app, then modified it.
synced with github - which results in a build on heroku visible at the url above
then got it running on local, foreman start web

now I have app running locally, that post sync with github (on master only) is then built on heroku and visible
Pretty cool.
